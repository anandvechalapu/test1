    <h2>Institute__c Trigger</h2>
    <p>A trigger will be created on the Institute__c object, which will monitor any updates to the institute record. If an update is made, the trigger will check all related Student__c records to see if their Status__c was created more than 30 days ago. If the status was created more than 30 days ago, the Student__c record will be updated to Inactive.</p>
